# Optimize_QSP
Optimization methods for quantum state preparation

# Installing
I suggest you install the code using ```pip``` from an [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) Python 3 environment. From that environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexandreday/Optmize_QSP.git
cd Optimize_QSP
pip install .
```
# Updating package
Since we are constanly updating the code, you will have to update it as new versions are rolled out. Here is
how to do it. As for the installation, use ```pip``` from an [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) Python 3 environment. From that environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexandreday/Optmize_QSP.git
cd Optimize_QSP
pip install . --upgrade
```
Another way is just to pull from the original Optimize_QSP repository:
```
git pull origin master
pip install . --upgrade
```
